<h2>
  The FAQs
</h2>
<p>
  So far, we’ve given you an <a href="/alumni-projects/alumni-consulting-initiative/jacobs-feed-episode-1">overview of the tuition postponement problems</a>, presented you with solutions to <a href="/alumni-projects/alumni-consulting-initiative/jacobs-feed-episode-2">get done with your loan quickly, save money and help the university in the process</a>. Now, we’d like to add one last finishing touch and get to the core of some of the most pressing questions around this topic, and also address some of the questions that have come our way since we started the campaign. All in all, the feedback has been surprisingly positive – (we were expecting way more trolling) – and we really appreciate that. With this final FAQ we hope to lay to rest the remaining questions that might still be lingering in your minds. Of course – should you have more questions about the ACI or the challenges faced on the Tuition Financing front, feel free to reach out to us – who worked on this stream of the ACI task force – &nbsp;Alexander Stimpfle, Shinta Harsana, Anna-Lena Schindl and Mitul K. Jain – we’ll do our best to help you within the limits of the confidentiality agreements that we need to respect. &nbsp;So without much further ado – let’s dive into those questions:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Let’s start with some statistics…</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <strong>What is the current total amount of loans that Jacobs has given out to students and that has not yet been paid back?</strong>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Approximately 23 million Euros, the exact number changes constantly based on payments and the interest applied.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
  <strong>How many of these are in default (non-performing / insufficient payments)?</strong>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  6.2 million of the 23 million €, the remaining 16,8 million are being paid back according to plan (“good loans”).
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <strong>How many Alumni are in default?</strong>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Around 240 Alumni, which is roughly every fourth Alumni with an active tuition postponement. The average defaulting loan amounts to 25,500 € (total default amount divided by number of “defaulting” Alumni). However, in reality the amounts that “defaulting” Alumni owe greatly varies. There are large outliers.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <strong>
      Who isn’t paying?
    </strong>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  There’s no standard demographic – it’s people from various nationalities (“poor” and “rich” nations), various majors and all classes (including the pioneer batch). It’s quite close to the overall “Jacobs demographics”. This is not about major, nationality or year of graduation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

<em>
<strong>
Can we publish a list with names of the defaulters? I really want to know who that is.
</strong>
</em>

</p>
<p>

No, this would be illegal (just like not repaying your loans is). Feel free to ask your friends to find out which ones are not paying. Then sit them down and explain to them why they need to.

</p>
<p>

<em>
<strong>
How does the university categorize defaulting / non-performing loans?
</strong>
</em>

</p>
<p>

Two things have to come together: An Alumnus/-a stopped paying back the loan or does not pay back according to plan,&nbsp;<strong>and</strong>&nbsp;that Alumnus/-a also stopped communicating to Jacobs University / does not respond to anything when they try to establish a contact.

</p>

<h2>
  Okay help me understand how repayment (or lack thereof) works..
</h2>

<p>
<em>
<strong>

Will the university send a collection agency after me if I don’t pay?

</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

Yes – the university is starting to take the matter very seriously. While these Alumni will get numerous kind warnings and reminders from the Financial Services office (this Dunning process and the entire “Loan Journey” from immatriculation until you pay-off your loan is also one of the things we’re currently working with the University on restructuring) – after a certain point non-performing loans will be handed over to a collection agency. Then it will also be too late to get back to Jacobs Financial Services, since they are no longer the counterparty. So it’s best to just avoid that scenario. If you are out of touch with the University and have not being paying – it might be best to get in touch with them to discuss your case (a reasonable contribution) before it gets handed over to collections.

</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>
It’s not like the Collection Agency can reach people in *insert country of choice here* anyways, what’s the point?
</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

The collection agency the University works with, specializes in the area of loan recovery for educational institutions and works together with a large number of universities in the world. Their network stretches to most countries both within and outside the EU.

</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>

I’m completely lost about repaying my loan – what can I do?

</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

First, it’s always recommended to get in touch with Financial Services, explaining to them the current situation and background. They are there to help and want to collaborate&nbsp;<strong>with&nbsp;</strong>the Alumni. &nbsp;Secondly – &nbsp;it may help to talk to friends about how they are paying it back – maybe they can give useful advice. Lastly – those Alumni that are already paying and want to optimize or save money – why not check out the interactive loan calculator that will soon be ready for you on the AlmaLink webpage.

</p>
<a class="mwm-aal-item" name="i-have-serious-difficulties-paying-i-live-in-a-developing-country-and-dont-earn-much-my-family-is-in-major-trouble-im-unemployed-and-have-been-trying-hard-to-find-something-for-years">
</a>
<p>
<strong>
<em>

I have serious difficulties paying / I live in a developing country and don’t earn much / my family is in major trouble / I’m unemployed and have been trying hard to find something for years!!

</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>

This is a very valid argument and there are many of these cases. The most important here is to talk to Jacobs Financial Services and keeping the contact active. They will help in all of the above scenarios and have processes in place. Nobody will judge in case Alumni face financial difficulties, but these need to reach out pro-actively. By shying away or “disappearing”, these issues will not be resolved, but Alumni may instead face a lot of trouble eventually (see collection agency). In case of unemployment, it might help to ask around in the Alumni association – there are a lot of alumni actively and passively looking for employees for the companies they work in. &nbsp;

</p>

<h2>
  Okay, I’m getting it – let’s talk communication!
</h2>
<p>
<em>
<strong>

Who should I talk to from the university about my student loan?

</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

Just google “jacobs university student financial services” and you get email, phone number etc. Or click here:&nbsp;<u>
<a class="c14" href="http://www.jacobs-university.de/finances/sfs_team" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit;">http://www.jacobs-university.de/finances/sfs_team</a>
</u>&nbsp;. When you did your final checkout – you were also assigned a financial aid officer responsible for you – reach out to them.

</p>
<a class="mwm-aal-item" name="i-never-receive-all-the-jacobs-emails-and-payment-reminders-and-then-they-even-send-letters-via-regular-mail-to-my-home-address-where-i-lived-at-high-school-why-is-that">
</a>
<p>
<em>
<strong>

I never receive all the Jacobs emails and payment reminders, and then they even send letters via regular mail to my home address where I lived at high school. Why is that?

</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

Many Alumni never provided Jacobs Financial Services with updated contact details. So in their system, these are probably still registered under the address indicated when applying to Jacobs as a high school student. Actually, at the check-out interview everyone signed that he/she would notify Jacobs immediately of address changes, but yes…many overlooked that clause. But as nobody is helped when outdated contact data are used, these Alumni are kindly asked to drop a short email to Financial Services to tell them correct email, postal address, and phone number.

</p>
<a class="mwm-aal-item" name="why-does-jacobs-financial-services-not-contact-me-via-linkedin-or-facebook-much-easier-than-the-hassle-with-letters-via-regular-mail-or-outdated-email-addresses">
</a>
<p>
<em>
<strong>

Why does Jacobs Financial Services not contact me via LinkedIn or Facebook? Much easier than the hassle with letters via regular mail or outdated email addresses?

</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

Because that is forbidden by German privacy law. Therefore, Jacobs only resorts to contact information which Alumni gave to them, and doesn’t contact anyone via other channels, unless Alumni tell them that they explicitly agree to that.

</p>
<a class="mwm-aal-item" name="why-does-jacobs-university-never-reach-out-to-me-personally-this-is-all-so-anonymous-and-distant-with-only-these-student-account-emails">
</a>
<p>
<em>
<strong>

Why does Jacobs University never reach out to me personally? This is all so anonymous and distant with only these student account emails.

</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

There are thousands (literally) of tuition postponement holders, so a more personal communication to each and every one puts serious strains on the capacity of the Financial Services Team. Especially with the current cost reduction program for the entire university going on in parallel, this kind of service is very difficult to realize. Moreover, a reaching-out in most cases is necessary because something on the Alumni side happened (Alumni cannot pay back, need to interrupt my payments etc.).So it is their responsibility to reach out in such cases to discuss the matter personally with Financial Services.

</p>
<a class="mwm-aal-item" name="let8217s-look-at-some-of-the-common-ethical-legal-issues-people-seem-to-face">
</a>

<h2>
  Let’s look at some of the common ethical / legal issues people seem to face
</h2>

<p>
<em>
<strong>
Why should I pay it back? I didn’t like studying there.
</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

That’s unfortunate. The fact however is, the University didn’t ask: “Why should I help this kid out?” when giving us (students, usually in their late teens &nbsp;/ early twenties, with no credit history – basically the highest risk category that exists) loans. This is a loan – like any other out there – you have a legal, and in the case of an educational loan, moral obligation to pay it back – since a good repayment rate will enable the University to continue giving loans to students who need them – instead of just becoming a school for the wealthy.

</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>

What’s the point – the university is in a financial mess anyways – will they even survive or will I just put my money into a blackhole?

</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

The university has commitments that will keep it going in the future too, major changes are being made internally to make it a more sustainable organization, and such an attitude torpedoes all these efforts. In fact: an improved student financing record is what will help attract donors and public institutions back, by giving them the confidence that their donation is appreciated and going to students who also have a sense of responsiblity for the generations after them. Also, not repaying the loans deprives future student generations of the chance to come study abroad, improve their life prospects, fulfil their dreams, opportunities that we were lucky enough to have! Not only is non-repayment illegal, it is also morally questionable – universally.

</p>
<a class="mwm-aal-item" name="i-dont-agree-with-the-future-strategy-of-jacobs-university-they-are-firing-professors-and-staff-and-now-they-want-my-money">
</a>
<p>
<em>
<strong>

I don’t agree with the future strategy of Jacobs University. They are firing professors and staff, and now they want my money?

</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

There have been several petitions put forward by students and Alumni which asked to stop the lay-off of certain professors or members of the administration. The fact is – if we assume that a professor’s annual salary is 70000 € per year (which is roughly in line with an average base salary at German public universities) – we could pay 9 full professorships for 10 years straight with the money of currently defaulting student loans. Paying back loans would help the university, but it could also directly help current and future student generations.

</a>
<p>
<em>
<strong>

Jacobs University claims to want to prepare global leaders of tomorrow – sometimes this involves joining NGOs and working in developing countries where you barely earn much. It’s not like we don’t want to pay – but why be so hard on those just following the same ideals that Jacobs has?

</a>
<p>

Let’s ignore for a second the fact that plenty of others may have put their ideals/dreams on hold for a few years in order to work and pay off their loan, and again focus on the topic of communication. Assume an alumnus is working in a remote corner of the world, trying to improve local conditions and earning just enough to sustain himself, how should he/she pay back a 15000 € loan? Fair question, and one that the university has also considered, and has plenty of understanding for.  In fact – for those who are in such situations and do reach out to the University there exist special conditions and programs, some of which will be made even more public in the days to come. However – if in such a situation – the alumnus in question decides that the solution is to stop paying and just wish the loan away and break all contact with the University, that’s when they’re causing problems, for themselves and for the University.  At the end of the day, this is a two-way street – the university is generous and more flexible than most other institutions. In turn, all they want is for all Alumni to be honest and up-front and communicate to Jacobs and work together to come up with a solution instead of disappearing. We think it’s a fair deal.

</p>
<a class="mwm-aal-item" name="i-would-have-never-signed-such-a-contract-if-i-had-understood-what-it-means-i-didnt-realize-this-i-was-so-young-and-inexperienced-and-now-i-should-cope-with-this-thats-unfair">
</a>
<p>
<em>
<strong>

I would have never signed such a contract if I had understood what it means. I didn’t realize this, I was so young and inexperienced, and now I should cope with this? That’s unfair.

</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

Everyone was at least 18 years old, thus legally an adult, when signing the contract, or the student’s parents signed if students were underage. So the contract is legally binding. Nobody was forced to come to this university, and in many cases Jacobs was even chosen for being the “cheapest” option in comparison to other leading private universities. Jacobs fulfilled its part of the deal, namely by granting a university education. Now it’s everyone’s turn to fulfill theirs. Comparable universities have the same procedures in place, usually even much more rigid ones – with the loans being a multiple of the average Jacobs loan burden. And in order to make sure no Alumni pays more than absolutely necessary, we summarized opportunities which can&nbsp;<u>
<a class="c14" href="https://www.jacobs-alumni.de/jacobsfeed2" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit;">save you a lot of cash</a>
</u>.

</p>
<a class="mwm-aal-item" name="jacobs-university-said-i-dont-need-to-worry-about-my-loan-when-i-do-a-master-or-phd-but-now-they-want-me-to-still-pay-something-why">
</a>
<p>
<em>
<strong>

Jacobs University said I don’t need to worry about my loan when I do a Master or PhD. But now they want me to still pay something. Why?

</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

A new policy is now in place that allows an extension of the grace period throughout the master’s studies (proof of matriculation must be submitted). This may also be granted for a PhD if the alumnus proves that the income received during this time is too low. We now communicate this policy, however, we do not recommend it due to the enormous increase in the debt if they don’t pay two to five or more years while accruing interest keeps piling up – usually unnoticed by the affected Alumni who “wake up” after years with a huge debt increase.

</p>
<p>
Otherwise, alumni are required to pay interest on the overall loan (the total sum owed at graduation) also during graduate/post-graduate studies. Only the 6 months right after Jacobs graduation are completely payment-free. The interest payments during graduate studies are the annual 7.75% of the loan face value, and serve to keep the loan amount “stable”. With that, after a 5-year Master+PhD, Alumni still owe the same amount as they did 6 months after graduation. So long story short: during graduate studies, no need to worry about paying back the loan, but need to worry about keeping the loan from increasing even further.
</p>

<h2>Questions to the details of the tuition postponement mechanism? Look no further!</h2>

<p>
<em>
<strong>

Why is Jacobs University charging 7.75% interest? That’s so much!

</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

If you understand the risk taken by the University in handing out these loans, the interest rate is actually low. Think about it – they are giving loans to kids from countries all over the world, with little or no understanding of their or their families’ credit histories and no collateral. That is as risky as it gets. &nbsp;Further, this interest rate has been verified by independent auditors as reflecting the risk exposure Jacobs is bearing with those loans. Jacobs University bears 100% of the risk, and all loan defaults directly eat up capital provided by the Jacobs Foundation. With that said, we encourage to check out our proposal for re-financing the Jacobs loan at a cheaper rate with a local bank, because nobody is forced to stick to that 7.75% if there is a better deal “outside”. It saves money!

<a class="mwm-aal-item" name="i-took-a-loan-of-2000-eur-per-semester-after-six-semesters-my-loan-at-graduation-is-not-6-x-2000-eur-12000-eur-but-higher-why-is-that">
</a>
<p>
<em>
<strong>

I took a loan of 2000 € per semester. After six semesters, my loan at graduation is not 6 x 2000 € = 12000 €, but higher. Why is that?

</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

Two words – compound interest – seriously, understanding this concept will save you all sorts of financial trouble in life. But – let’s illustrate the Jacobs case a bit: Jacobs University charges interest on every loan, starting at day one of the studies (September 01 and February 01). Therefore, at graduation, students will have already accumulated years of interest on the amount borrowed. This interest due is simply added to the face value (the 12,000 EUR) and then shows up on the student account statement as additional debt.

</p>
<a class="mwm-aal-item" name="why-is-jacobs-university-giving-out-loans-in-general-cant-a-german-bank-do-that-instead">
</a>
<p>
<em>
<strong>

Why is Jacobs University giving out loans in general? Can’t a German bank do that instead?

</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

There has been such a co-operation with the Sparkasse Bremen for the pioneer class of 2004. However, Sparkasse Bremen stepped back because of bad experience and has opposed any co-operation or risk-sharing since then. The same goes basically for other banks. There is simply no financial institution out there willing to take on that “risk pool” of international needy students with no loan securities, background check, etc. So in order to keep a need-blind admission and live the Jacobs values in practice, the university decided to step in and give out loans itself.

</p>

<h2>And finally, to the critics..&nbsp;</h2>

<p>
<em>
<strong>
Why is all this serious information in such an “unprofessional” tone and format? Do you or Jacobs University think this is funny?
</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

This is not a funny topic. The purpose of the campaign was to create awareness – and get the message across to as many people as possible. In the interest of virality – we decided to take a slightly entertaining approach. We’ve seen how non-transparent, or patronizing communications from the University or the Alumni Board have come across stiff resistance. Generally, a moralizing undertone, being dead serious, or conveying pessimism do not help in getting the Alumni community thinking about what has been going wrong and what can be done to improve things. So we decided to go for the “BuzzFeed” style format which everyone is familiar with – and makes these painful facts easier to digest and understand. At the end of the day – there’s no one format that everyone would like, if this format generates controversy but gets eyeballs on the issue, that’s something we can live with.

</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>

What’s with the “bad apples” – why do you assume that everyone not paying back their loan is just out to cheat the university?

</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

In short – we don’t. &nbsp;In fact our campaign is aimed at 2 things: The first, to bring attention to the real bad apples (more on this shortly) and the second, to help those who aren’t paying because they’re truly in some kind of a tough situation understand that they do have other options and need to communicate with Jacobs.

</p>
<p>

Now for the really bad apples – its’ pretty straight forward – a thorough study of the data and research related to that – makes it blaringly clear that out of the defaulting alumni there are a fair number that do actually have a stable source of income. &nbsp;Those are the really rotten apples. &nbsp;Then there are those who aren’t paying because of difficulties – this is understandable and the university will help you if you cooperate with them. The problem though is – there are plenty of the latter (people with difficulties) who think that the best thing to do is to break communication and to “disappear”. We want to make it clear and obvious that this is NOT the right approach. &nbsp;Non-paying + non-communicating parties – regardless of how tough their situation might be will always come across as bad apples. How is the university supposed to help you – if you do not reply to any of their emails?

</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>

Why are you only communicating this stuff to make us feel guilty and not saying anything about the other financial issues at the university and all our favorite professors being laid off?

</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

The Alumni Consulting Initiative was formed to help the university in specific areas of key importance. One of the topics we focused on was tuition financing, since, as alumni and tuition postponement recipients, we would be best equipped to help the university restructure things on this front. &nbsp;We received unprecedented access to data and information from the University and also reached out to affected alumni to understand their paint points with the way tuition financing is handled. Based on our data-crunching as well as the qualitative inputs we suggested a set of 15 measures (some of which have already been implemented – e.g. the 10% &nbsp;TP discount for this year!) which the university has accepted and will implement in the next months. This campaign is in itself a very small part of the bigger work we’re doing as a part of the ACI. We are not at all involved in any of the resource-related decisions / cuts at the university. In short – we’re focusing on the things we’ve worked on and understand, because we believe that’s where we can make the most impact and don’t see it fit to comment on issue we aren’t as well informed about.

</p>
<a class="mwm-aal-item" name="i-think-this-is-a-second-priority-topic-for-everyone-if-we-put-things-into-perspective-some-alumni-just-have-too-much-time-and-now-make-a-fuss-out-of-it">
</a>
<p>
<em>
<strong>

I think this is a second-priority topic for everyone if we put things into perspective. Some Alumni just have too much time and now make a fuss out of it.

</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>

The issue around the default track record of Jacobs Alumni is a top priority for the Jacobs leadership and Jacobs University stakeholders (e.g., the Jacobs Foundation). It is also an area where Alumni can have a concrete impact in terms of building a reputation for honesty and responsibility, as well as supporting the university financially by simply adhering to their loan contracts. Furthermore, the Alumni Consulting Initiative has been asked to support the university with their most pressing issues – not by coincidence, the topic where the university asked for support is this one. Also trust us, we’d love to have more free time ;).
