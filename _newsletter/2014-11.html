  Amidst the change process at Jacobs University Imke Sonnenberg has left her duties as Alumni Officer. After 10 years of dedicated work for the university, we were saddened to see her go. Imke took a strong lead in shaping the structure of the Alumni Office in its very first years and was an essential part in bringing many of our Alumni Projects to life, like the Alumni Scholarship! We thank her for the dedication to our Alumni work and all the efforts and time she invested. <strong> </strong>

  Generation Fund – a sustainable Alumni Scholarship 2.0
  <a id="Generation Fund - a sustainable Alumni Scholarship 2.0" name="Generation Fund - a sustainable Alumni Scholarship 2.0"></a>

<p>
  The idea of an Alumni Scholarship originated at the five-year reunion of the Class of 2004, who wanted to donate to an individual who would carry on the pioneering spirit of the class. This idea was further undertaken in the following years, on behalf of Alumni who felt strongly committed to contribute. These scholarships were linked to the graduating class, each having a Donating Class Committee, elected from within its body, which were defining the theme of the scholarship, and hence the criteria that the recipient will need to to fulfil.
</p>
<p>
  So far, the scholarships have been a remarkable example of Alumni involvement and giving back to the unique place which we all called home. This year, we are planning to take on a further step, and introduce a new and improved Alumni Scholarship – the <strong>Generation Fund</strong>, which has already been kicked off at the Homecoming dinner of Class of ‘04 and ‘09. Its key feature will be self-sustainability. While in the past donations have been given once and were “lost” forever afterwards, donations to the Generation Fund are investments in the education of bright Jacobs students who will – in return – prepare the ground for further generations to come. This concept sets up a new pioneering, future-oriented way of funding university studies that will have the potential to revolutionize the current system we all know at Jacobs.
</p>
<p>
  The idea to initiate the Generation Fund originated from the Alumni Consulting Initiative (ACI), who has been working on various projects offering consulting support to the university. The “Reversed Generation Commitment” (Umgekehrter Generationenvertrag) has already been successfully introduced in most of the German private universities where it has been designed as an alternative to student loans and as a way for Alumni to stay involved with the university community. Some of us have graduated one, two, others even ten years ago – but we all share the same Jacobs spirit, no matter where we are in the world. This bond makes us want to give back and get involved, which will be possible through the Generation Fund.
</p>
<p>
  How does it work? The student awarded with the scholarship will not pay anything or only very little during his or her studies at Jacobs. Upon obtaining the first full-time job after graduation, this person will have to put an agreed-upon percentage of his or her salary every month for a certain period of time back into the fund. Gradually, the fund grows, and the bigger it gets, the higher the number of new awardees who will be able to benefit from it. The repayment terms will be transparent, and will be kept the same for all scholarship holders. It will enable them to choose the career that really fits their passions, as they would not be forced to take jobs with high salaries in order to repay student loans.
</p>
<p>
  The Generation Fund is introduced this year for the first time, with results only starting to be noticed when the first scholarship holders start repayment. Until then, the Alumni Board, together with ACI are designing the process outline and implementation details specific for Jacobs. And it promises to be a success, as at the Homecoming dinner, already 20’000 Euros have been pledged. But we need more support in order for the fund to grow. As an Alumni, there are various way YOU can get involved – donate<sup> <a href="#1">1</a>
  </sup>, join the Donation Class Committee<sup> <a href="#2">2</a>
  </sup> or support with the process design <a href="#3">
  <sup>3</sup>
  </a>.
</p>
<p>
  We are confident that this new structure establishes a sustainable and long-lasting way forward for Alumni contribution to Jacobs, as being part of the global network of Jacobs Alumni! Thus, keep checking AlmaLink, as more information is coming soon.

<p>
  This year’s General Assembly took place on the 20<sup>th</sup> of September in the usual place, Conrad Naber Hall. On the sunny Saturday morning, more than 60 alumni gathered to get over their hangovers from the night before and to hear the latest updates from the university leadership and the Alumni Board reports.
</p>
<p>
  Prof. Michael Hülsmann, the managing director, filling in for Prof. Katja Windt, offered the present alumni an insight into the first results of the change process. Together with the ACI, Heiko Walkenhorst, the director of admissions, launched a campaign asking for alumni support in the cities where the university admissions team will be doing recruiting. Alumni can help represent the university in schools, educational fairs and even help assess candidates. All interested alumni are encouraged to sign up with <a href="mailto:h.walkenhorst@jacobs-university.de">Heiko</a> and will be rewarded with a cool blue Jacobs duck.
</p>
<p>
  Axel Domeyer, from the Alumni Consulting Initiative, also gave a short overview of the work that the ACI is currently helping the university with, starting from student marketing to tuition financing and beyond. The short presentation can be downloaded <a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ACI_AlumniGAInfo2014.pdf">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The GA continued with a presentation by Peter, who introduced the vision of the Alumni Association and leading WHYs behind the Board’s decisions in the past year. The main goals outlined were: Empowered, Knowledgeable, Transparent, Supportive, Unbureaucratic and Financially Independent.
</p>
<p>
  The new AlmaLink 2.0, one of the main means of achieving the above-mentioned goals was presented by Stefan, who gave a quick run through the web interface and the main features of the online system. As it is a growing platform which is still under development, your input is gladly appreciated and encouraged, whether as a <a href="/blog">blogger</a>, <a href="/campusnews">contributor to updates from campus</a> or from <a href="/chapters">Alumni Chapters</a> all over the world, or a technically-inclined alumnus interested the website. Since you already logged in and are reading this page, now would be the right time to check out your <a href="/profile">profile</a> and fill out the missing parts.
</p>
<p>
  A proposal for a Fee Model for the Alumni Association was also introduced by Board through Konstantin, and there was a general discussion about what Alumni are willing to pay for in terms of support for the Association. A group was created to take this discussion further and come up with an improved proposal. If you want to join the fees discussion, you can do it by sending <a href="mailto:sturhan@jacobs-alumni.de">Suna</a> an email.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most important changes which were introduced at this year’s GA was the new Alumni Association Charter. The approved <a href="/changes2014">changes</a> make our Association officially non-profit, which allows us to have our own bank account and gain tax advantages. Other important changes can be read in the <a href="#">FAQ</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, the GA concluded with elections for the four open Alumni Board positions and the two Auditors. As explained on <a href="/ElectionResults">elections results page</a>, Daniel Garcia(‘08) was elected as Vice-President, while Alina Degtiarova(‘13), Elena Isac(‘12) and Stefan Rustler(‘12) were elected as Assessors. Both Cristian Mihut(‘07) and Tory Sigmond(‘10) were appointed Auditors of the Board.

<p>
  This year’s 5-year and 10-year reunion of the pioneering Class 2004 as well as Class 2009, combined with the homecoming of alumni from other classes, was successful in all ways.
</p>
<p>
  Not only did participants at the delicious reunion dinner at Strandlust learn, that Peter Dabrowski, President of the Alumni Association, had been the first person to name fellow alumnus Serkan Kulaksiz “Jesus” (Class 2004, 2006 and 2012), but also did they pledge about 20.000 Euros in total for the new Generation Fund – a truly great sum.  Moreover, the organizing team of our Alumni’s Homecoming managed to creatively provide networking opportunities between current students and alumni, as well as interesting companies during an excellent Career Symposium with representatives from Barry Callebaut, Daimler, Skype, Continental and others.
</p>
<p>
  Networking lunches and several parties on campus allowed for a positive mix of fun, business and diving into sentimental nostalgia. On Saturday, alumni were invited to contribute with their feedback on a range of topics, e.g. the Charter changes, and through voting on the new Board representatives, during the General Assembly in Reimar-Lüst-Hall. Bremen treated us nicely- with late summer weather in September and free Beck’s beer in between.
</p>
<p>
  Clearly,  we have been really lucky and many of us regained a lot of positive energy from this great weekend. <strong>We can’t wait for next homecoming to welcome you once again at home on campus!</strong>
