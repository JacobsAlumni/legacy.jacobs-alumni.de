  Here’s a story about Jacobs University that will blow your mind…
</p>
<p>
  Jacobs University is in financial peril. The place we called home – is fighting to clean up its books. There’s one bad apple that we (the Alumni) are to blame for. You guessed it – Tuition Postponement.
</p>
<p>
  This series of articles, brought to you by the Alumni Consulting Initiative with support from the Alumni Board and in collaboration with the University itself, will give you the low down on all things around tuition postponement. The series starts with a detailed look at the numbers – where is all that money? How much is it? Well.. be prepared to have your mind expanded!

<p>
  So you’re probably wondering how bad things are financially at the University? More specifically – you want to know how big of a role the arguably dysfunctional Tuition Postponement system has to play in the current fiasco? Let’s start with one number.
</p>
<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-center">
  <strong>23 million €</strong>
</p>
<p>
  That’s how many Euros – we the proud Alumni of Jacobs University currently owe our Alma Mater. Growing at 7,75% p.a. as you read this.

  <em>Yes – that’s 22,999,999 more than the number of expressions Kirsten Stewart is capable of.</em>
</p>
<p>
  Currently, that’s enough money to buy this island off the coast of Portugal:

<h2>
  Why is this a bad thing? Isn’t the University <em>earning</em> money this way?
</h2>
<p>
  Well – it’s not all bad. The truth is, a good number of these loans are fine. They’re being serviced regularly (i.e. people are paying their installments on schedule).
</p>

<p>
  <em>These were also the nice people you usually wanted to sit with in the servery.</em>
</p>
<h2>
  So the problem is?
</h2>
<p>
  Well, the problem is the non-performers. No, we don’t mean those who got 3.something GPAs – we mean the ones who aren’t paying back the way they should. These are fellow Alumni who not only stopped paying back their loans, but also avoid any kind of communication with the University. Some of them don’t respond to multiple calls, emails and other attempts to make contact by the University
</p>

</p>
<h2>
  Ok so I guess it’s just a few bad apples right ?
</h2>
<p>
  We wish this were the case. The fact is 25% of the total outstanding loan amount is currently in default (insufficient or no payments or communication). <strong>This is owed by 24% of all Alumni who still have loans from the University.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  <em>Yup, a financial “wrecking ball”.</em>
</p>

  I failed ESM1A – help me understand more.
</h2>
<p>
  Well of these 23 million owed to the University, around 6.2 million € are missing without a clear trace at the moment. The people owing this money are neither paying up nor are they responding to any attempts to make contact by the university nor are they reaching out to Jacobs to find a mutual solution. Ironically – some of them actively show up on Social Media as having good jobs, come to events on campus – and even donate to Alumni Scholarships! They just don’t seem to want to pay their dues. Some extreme cases have had to be handed over to collection agents unfortunately.

  <em>They may look cute, but they will collect.</em>
</p>
<h2>
  Well yeah, but 6.2 million is not Island material – who cares?
</h2>
<p>
  We figured you’d ask – so here’s some interesting things (and probably more useful than an Island) you can do with that kind of cash:
</p>

<p>
  <em>Or 3 satisfactory meals in the servery. Wait, who are we kidding – satisfactory? Lol.</em>
</p>
<p>
  The fact is – this is a significant amount of money that the University currently cannot count on – which could be really useful in these pressing times.
</p>
<p>
  We all have friends who are still paying their loans back and some who aren’t doing even a little bit. These are the ones making it harder for the University to keep giving loans to deserving students – like you and I – who wouldn’t have a chance for a great international experience and a solid education otherwise! This is of course apart from all the other painful austerity measures that we know the University has to exercise at the moment.
</p>
<h2>
  Ok ok I get it – but I’ve already paid my loan / am paying it regularly – what can I do about this?
</h2>

  We’re glad you asked! Truth be told, you may be doing things right, but almost 25% of the Alumni who still have loans aren’t. This means, the odds are that maybe one or more of your close friends – is one of these non-performers. We, as fellow Alumni, hope that understanding the magnitude of the problem encourages you to talk to them and help them see that they really need to start paying again. Also for their own benefit!
</p>
<p>
  Yes – their own benefit. You see – loans are not magical that if you wish them away hard enough they disappear. They get bigger and badder – like the Hulk, except less fun. So early repayment will actually save your defaulting friends money in the long run, and a lot of pain (refer to collection agent above!). In fact the University has some interesting offers and support in place – to help you if you are struggling and also if on the other hand you are keen on paying it all off faster.
</p>
<p>
  In the next articles – we will help you understand some of these offers from the University and show you how even if you are paying regularly, you can clearly help the university by paying back more and faster, <strong>while saving money in the process!</strong> More on this WIN-WIN-Situation to follow soon!
