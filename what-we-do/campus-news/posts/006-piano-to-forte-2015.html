  <strong>Piano to Forte: Students of Jacobs University Perform for a Good Cause</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Dear Alumni, </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Once more, Jacobs University will open its doors to host the traditional “Piano to Forte” concerts: Talented young people from all over the world will play pieces from a variety of genres – all proceeds will benefit a social cause. The concerts, organized by students, will take place on the 30<sup>th</sup> and 31<sup>st</sup> of October at 7.30 pm respectively on the campus of Jacobs University Bremen.

  Initially an informal event more resembling a talent show for students, the event has grown to be the biggest campus event organized by students. Last year, 900 guests came to experience the musical diversity offered by the international performers. Every visitor additionally helps to support a good cause, as all proceeds of the event traditionally go to student run club “G.I.V.E. – Gegenseitig Inspirieren, Vielfalt Erleben”. This club supports various initiatives and projects run by Jacobs University students both in the city of Bremen and their direct neighborhood.
