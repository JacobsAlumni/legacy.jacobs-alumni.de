### Our mission - For the Association and for Alumni

* We are most diverse. We want to enable our alumni to *connect* and continue to grow their Jacobs network after Jacobs. 
* We are a *shareholder* of the University. We thus have a strong voice in its development - and want to make sure to *represent* our Alumni.
* We are committed to creating *benefits* and *opportunities* for our Alumni. Both directly by our services and events and indirectly by the connections we enable. 
* We are deeply connected with Jacobs. We do not only want to see our alumni *thrive* but also our alma mater. Thriving is living the Jacobs spirit. Lifelong. Globally.

### Our vision - Stewards of the Jacobs Spirit

Jacobs University has been through turbulent times. 
In all the change processes the Alumni Association considers itself as a constant and *steward of the Jacobs Spirit*. 
With our increasingly stronger voice, we want to actively shape the University and ensure the Jacobs Spirit lives on and continues to have a lasting *impact on the Jacobs community and the world*.

We are Jacobs - Join us!
