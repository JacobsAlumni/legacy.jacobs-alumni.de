  Dear Alumni,
</p>
<p>
  We would like to inform you about the first Jacobs Career Fair, taking place in the Campus Center / IRC on the 25<sup>th</sup> of February 2015, 14-17 hrs. please mark your calendars.
</p>
<p>
  At the Jacobs Career Fair, you will have opportunities to talk directly to representatives of exciting employers – companies, organizations, research institutes and NGOs. We give our best to compose the exhibitors’ portfolio to best fit the needs of most Jacobs University students and alumni.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the exhibitors will also run company presentations in our Conference Center during the fair. Additionally, you will have the possibility to visit some useful workshops or even conduct a workshop for interested students yourself (in that case please contact Petra Zarrath <a href="mailto:p.zarrath@jacobs-university.de" target="_blank">p.zarrath@jacobs-university.de</a> ). We will publish the program and the full exhibitors’ catalogue on our website soon. We are still receiving registrations from employers – the list you currently see is not the final one. Please stay tuned – there will be more information about the fair, especially at the end of the Winter Intersession.
</p>
<p>
  We are very excited about the first fair of such kind at our university! But: As a very small university in comparison even to mid-sized German universities, we have the challenge to really make the Career Fair alive – therefore we need the support of the whole Jacobs University community and every single student and alumni! Let us make this a success story for you and future student generations!
</p>
<p>
  Best regards,
</p>
<p>
  Your Career Services Center Team
