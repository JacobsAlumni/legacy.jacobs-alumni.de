<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
  The Homecoming Organization Committee is excited to welcome you for this year’s Homecoming from 22nd – 24th of September on campus. The Class Representatives of 2007 and 2012, Stefan Rustler and Henrik Maedler along with the organization team consisting of Lida Lottko, Diana Wells, Adriana Trutzenberg, Hasan Tahir, Devashish Tikekar, Alex Taskov, Max Lüth, Flo Sturm and Max Lüth are working hard towards making this yet another memorable event for all Alumni “coming home”.
</p>
<p>
  Many things will be the like the previous year, most notably the combination of Homecoming with the Symposium on Friday and the Jacobs Games (formerly Olympix). We are excited to host this year’s Gala Dinner at Jacobs University in the Campus Center’s East Wing. Like last year, the dinner will be open to all Alumni, regardless of their graduating class. We are also very excited to move the Alumni Association Assembly to Saturday Afternoon – allowing all of us to enjoy a calm Saturday morning on campus and to be well rested for the Homecoming party on Saturday Night.
</p>

<h2>Ticket sales</h2>

<p>
  The ticket sales will be opened from August 11th onwards. There are three ticket options – from the full package to the basic ticket for just a few Euros. Unfortunately, there will be no rooms to stay on campus this year because of a very big incoming Class of 2020. <strong>To facilitate your stay in Bremen, we have blocked a number of rooms at local hotels in Bremen Nord or downtown.</strong> You can find all information <a target="_blank" href="/media/what-we-do/homecoming/2017/HC 2017 - Hotels Overview.pdf">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Career Symposium</h2>
<p>
  We are also pleased to invite you to the Jacobs Career Symposium 2017, organized by the Career Services Center in close cooperation with the Alumni Association. You can use this opportunity to enlarge your network, meeting Jacobs Alumni as company representatives and other top representatives of amazing corporates. The panel discussion will be followed by a networking event with students, alumni, faculty and company representatives. Snacks and drinks will be provided. A separate registration on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/jacobs-career-symposium-2017-registration-36051639424">EventBrite</Link> is required for this, as name tags will be prepared for you.

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p>
  <strong>I am not part of Class of 2007 or 2012. Can I still join the event?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Absolutely! Homecoming is an event for all Jacobs alumni – and their partners and children. That includes recent graduates and also exchange students. As in the previous year the Gala Dinner at East Wing will be open to all alumni. Note, however, that you have to be an official member of the Alumni Association in order to purchase tickets for Homecoming, having paid the membership contribution. Tickets may be purchased for fellow alumni.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>What will happen at the Gala Dinner?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  This year’s Gala Dinner will happen in the East Wing of the Campus Center, which will open its doors at 6pm on Saturday for a champagne reception. At 7:00pm the agenda will begin with a welcome address, after which the grand buffet will be openedwe will enjoy a three-course dinner. Two bottles of wine and water are included for each table of eight. And yes, you can bring your partner along. This year we will also have some musical performances by students! Please note that participation is only included in the full ticket.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Will there be any sports activities?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  We are lucky to have Olympix – now “Jacobs Games” – taking place on the same weekend as Homecoming. Alumni are invited to join the “graduate teams” and be once again part of this crazy competition. Sports alumni can join are the following: Basketball, Football, Dodgeball, Volleyball, Tug of War, E-sports. You may already voice your interested in joining any sport by writing to <a href="mailto:homecoming@jacobs-alumni.de">homecoming@jacobs-alumni.de</a> but we will also send out a survey for this purpose closer to the events once also the grad captains are settled. The main venue of the Jacobs Games will be the Sports and Convention Center, where there are also showers available. A detailed schedule of the event can be found at the bottom of this page when it becomes available. One event that we would like to point out here, though, is the Cheerleading Finale right after the Gala Dinner on Saturday. An alumni group will be performing (out of competition), too!

</p>
<p>
  After the deadline for the registration passes (September 17), you may sign up during a late-registration time slot scheduled to Thursday, September 21, 12pm CET till Friday, September 22, 3pm. After this time slot no registrations will be accepted.

</p>
<p>
  <strong>Can I get accommodation on campus?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, this year there is no on-campus accommodation available. Even the Guest House is fully booked. The rooms in College Nordmetall will be filled up with freshmen – a large class is expected this year. Check the section for off-campus accommodation below for further advice.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>What about accommodation off-campus?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  You can of course book accommodation in any hotel there is in Bremen, preferably well advance, as rooms are booked out quickly. We encourage you to also get in touch with your former host family in Bremen. Maybe you can arrange a night or two with them. In addition to this, we have reserved several rooms in Hotels in Bremen. In order to take advantage of this, simply state that you are a participant of “Jacobs University Alumni Homecoming 2017” when making the booking.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>I am staying not too close to campus. Can store luggage and change on campus?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Since this year there will not be any on-campus accommodation available due to the large incoming student batch, we are making every effort to mitigate any inconveniences caused especially for those staying further away from campus. In particular, on Saturday there are two dress codes, casual for the day and formal for the evening, and going back to your hotel to change might not be feasible. We put a slot in which you can change, from after the General Assembly at 16:30 to the beginning of the Gala Danner at 19:00. However, if this is to short you can bring the outfit for the evening to campus (or any other belongings) and store it in the Alumni Lounge (see map in agenda), which is open between 10:00 and 20:00. This is a general alumni meeting spot that will be looked after by a student assistant. You can change in the bathrooms there or go over to the Sports & Convention Center and use its changing rooms. Any stuff that you want to leave for the night, you can leave at the Alumni Lounge, which will be closed for the night and re-opened the following morning. You may also bring any belongings to the party, which has a cloakroom set up. Please note that any of those storing services are at your own risk and that we cannot be held liable for any damage or loss that might occur to your belongings.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Where can I get my Welcome Package and what is in it?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The Welcome Packages will be ready in the foyer of the foyer of the university Campus Center. If you are arriving late, you can also pick them up Saturday during the Chill&amp;Grill-BBQ. The package will include your wristband for the BBQ, Gala Dinner and party, meal vouchers, prints of all schedules.
