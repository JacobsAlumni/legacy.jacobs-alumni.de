  <strong>Alumni Association Charter Changes </strong>

  </h1>
  <p>Dear fellow Alumni,</p>
  <div>
  <div>This year’ s homecoming will mark the 10 year existence of our association. Your contribution keeps the Association running. Thank you for that.&nbsp;<p>
  </p>
  <p>Some of our projects are slowly turning into operational business, while new challenges keep us on our feet. One could say, we are slowly growing up.
  </p>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div>
  <div>With the experience we have gathered over the past years we saw the pressing need to also adapt our Charter in a way that would simplify our way of working together and of facilitating engagement of us as alumni.<p>
  </p>
  <p>Therefore, in the past months, we have worked on modifying the Charter of our Alumni Association.</p>
  <p>Some of the aims of the proposed Charter changes consist of</p>
  </div>
  <div>
  <ul>
  <li>decreasing bureaucracy</li>
  </ul>
  <div>
  <ul>
  <li>facilitating donations from alumni to the association and the university</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
  <ul>
  <li>increasing flexibility to add supporting members to the board</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
  <ul>
  <li>simplifying the election process and</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div>
  <ul>
  <li>clearly formulating a framework for streams of income via fees, which were generally approved at the GA of 2008</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <ul>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <p>Please note: We have worked on finally being an Association that is non-profit, in German “gemeinnützig”, by law. For this to happen, the preamble of the old Charter had to be deleted.</p>
  <p>Here is the proposed <a style="color: #00B1EC;" href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/JacobsUniversityAlumniAssociationCHARTER_FINAL_20140822_ENGLISH_0.doc" target="_blank">
