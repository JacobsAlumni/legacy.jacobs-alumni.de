<h2>FAQs</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Why do I have to register again? I thought I have done that before. And why do I have to pay an extra 39€?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The Jacobs Alumni Association has very recently implemented “membership contributions” after the General Assembly 2014 voted in favor of such fees.  As a consequence, in order to officially join the Alumni Association, alumni have to register again and pay a fee. Tickets for Homecoming can only then be purchased. Please note that the payment of the membership fees merely happens to coincide with the Homecoming ticket sales and does not go towards funding the event. For more information on where this money goes, the contributions levels and waivers for students, please follow the <a href="https://register.jacobs-alumni.de" target="_blank">registration steps</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19guVw-fBrtHWBJ9Ejq8n73C7wU7zlCMURn943qwlka4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
<p>
  <strong>I’m having trouble to log in. How do I set up a new account or reset my password?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  If you are unsure about your log in details, make sure you type in your username as <em>ppan@jacobs-alumni.de</em> (for Peter Pan) as well as trying to log in on <a href="http://mail.jacobs-alumni.de" target="_blank">mail.jacobs-alumni.de</a> first, before getting in touch with us via <a href="mailto:support@jacobs-alumni.de">support@jacobs-alumni.de</a>. We can then send you your username and new password. If you are still experiencing any trouble, you can make your reservation via e-mail to <a href="mailto:homecoming@jacobs-alumni.de">homecoming@jacobs-alumni.de</a>.</p>
<p>
  <strong>I am not part of Class of 2006 or 2011. Can I still join the event?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Absolutely! Homecoming is an event for all Jacobs alumni – and their partners. That includes recent graduates and also exchange students. For the first time also the Gala Dinner at Strandlust will be open to all alumni. Note, however, that you have to be an official member of the Alumni Association in order to purchase tickets for Homecoming, having paid the membership contribution.</p>
<p>
  <strong>What will hapen at the Gala Dinner?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  This year’s Gala Dinner will happen in the main hall of Hotel Strandlust, which will open its doors at 6pm on Saturday. At 6:30pm the agenda will being with welcome address followed by a three-course meal including two bottles of wine and water per table. And yes, you can bring your partner along. This year we will also have some musical performances by students!<br/>
  Though the event is officially scheduled to end at 9pm because the cheerleading finale is at 9:30pm, you may of course stay longer. In order to accommodate a large number to get back to campus, the taxi company <a href="http://www.funkwagen-susi.de/startseite/" target="_blank">Funkwagen Susi</a> has been informed. You can call them via +49 421 62 1111.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Will there be any sports activities?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  We are lucky to have Olympix – now “Jacobs Games” – taking place on the same weekend as Homecoming. Alumni are invited to join the “graduate teams” and be once again part of this crazy competition. Sports alumni can join are the follwoing: Basketball, Football, Dodgeball, Volleyball, Tug of War, E-sports. You may already voice your interested in joining any sport by writing to <a href="mailto:homecoming@jacobs-alumni.de">homecoming@jacobs-alumni.de</a> but we will also send out a survey for this purpose closer to the events once also the grad captains are settled. The main venue of the Jacobs Games will be the Sports and Convention Center, where there are also showers available. A detailed schedule of the event can be found <a href="http://jacobs-alumni.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/JG16_FinalSchedule.pdf">here</a> and at the bottom of this page. One event that we would like to point out here, though, is the cheerleading finale right after the Gala Dinner on Saturday;)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Where can I RSVP for Homecoming and check who else is coming?</strong>

<p>
  <strong>What ticket options are there and what are the prices?</strong>
</p>

  This year participants will be able to bundle the own pacakges: You can choose whether to join the Gala Dinner (by choosing the “Jacobs Platinum” versus the “Jacobs Blue” package), and whether you need accommodation (by choosing one of the room options). For transparency purposes, we would like to make sure you understand the <a href="http://jacobs-alumni.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/TicketPriceBreakdown_HC2016.png">composition of costs of the packages</a> and the <a href="http://www.jacobs-university.de/accommodation/guesthouse" target="_blank">accommodation</a>.

<p>
  <strong>How can I make donations?</strong>

<p>
  <strong>I missed the registration deadline but would still like to attend. Can I still sign up?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  After the deadline for the registration passes (September 18), you may sign up during a late-registration time slot scheduled to Thursday, September 22, 12pm CET till Friday, September 23, 3pm. After this time slot no registrations will be accepted. </p>
<p>
  <strong>Can I cancel my ticket purchases?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Please refer to our cancellation policy to be found <a href="http://jacobs-alumni.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CancellationPolicy_HC16.png">here</a>.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Can I get accommodation on campus?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, this year on-campus accommodation is limited to a few single and double rooms in the Guest House. The rooms in College Nordmetall will be filled up with freshmen – a large class is expected this year. When reserving a double room, please make sure to enter your roommate’s name in the respective field under “Additional Information” in the checkout step of the registration. Only then can we make a proper assignment. For any further questions on accommodation, please contact <a href="mailto:homecoming@jacobs-alumni.de">homecoming@jacobs-alumni.de</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>What about accommodation off-campus?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  You can of course book accommodation in any hotel there is in Bremen, preferably well advance, as rooms are booked out quickly. We encourage you to also get in touch with your former host family in Bremen. Maybe you can arrange a night or two with them. In addition to this, the Alumni Office has <a href="http://jacobs-alumni.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HotelsAlumniHomecoming2016_14.07.2016.pdf" target="_blank">reserved several rooms in Hotels in Bremen</a>. In order to take advantage of this, simply state that you are a participant of “Jacobs University Alumni Homecoming 2016” when making the booking.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Where can I get my Welcome Package and what is in it?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The Welcome Packages will be ready in the foyer of Reimer-Lüst-Hall, the admin building of the university. If you are arriving late, you can also pick them up Saturday morning just before the General Assembly. The package will include your wristband for the BBQ, Gala Dinner and party, meal vouchers, prints of all schedules. If you are staying on campus, your room keys need to be picked up by the porters (also return them there). To be able to flexibly purchase meals, you can obtain and top up guest meal cards at the porters, too. However, we encourage you to buy vouchers in our online shop, so we can plan better – and you don’t run into any bottlenecks when getting and returning the cards.
