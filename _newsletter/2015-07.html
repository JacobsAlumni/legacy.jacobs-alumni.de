  Get pumped for Homecoming 2015! - Registrations opening soon
</h2>
<p>
  The Homecoming Organization Committee can’t wait to see you for <strong>Homecoming from 25th – 27th of September</strong> on campus. And we are sure many of your former classmates can’t wait either.
</p>
<p>
  With this year’s theme “<strong>Then and Now</strong>” we would like to take the chance to bring back memories from old times on campus, either as an IUB or as a Jacobs student: Attend lectures with your old professors, join the formal dinner – this year on campus, and party it up with students and alumni alike. However, the theme also wants to recognize the current times: Join the Career Symposium, get first-hand updates from the university, and simply catch up with the many alumni. Nostalgia for the past and appreciation of the present – Homecoming 2015 will have it all.
</p>
<p>
  We are lucky to have <strong>Olympix </strong>–<strong> now “Jacobs Games” </strong>– taking place on the<strong> same weekend as Homecoming</strong>. Alumni are invited to join the “graduate teams” and be once again part of this crazy competition. Drop an e-mail to Stefy (Class of 2010) to get more information. The sports event is only complete with a grand party on Saturday night. For this current and former members of TheOtherSide are teaming up to present to you the theme party <strong>“From Athens to Rio”</strong>. This will also be a tribute to the class of 2005, which started TheOtherSide and brought theme parties to campus.
</p>
<p>
  The nostalgia has already started on social media with the <strong>challenge “cu@homecoming”</strong>. In this campaign friends are nominated with a fun memory from Jacobs. If you already have been nominated, indulge in the nostalgia and nominate your friends, too! And don’t forget to show your fellow alumni that you are joining by <strong>RSVPing on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/623093371125840/">Facebook-Event for Homecoming 2015</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
  This year there will be <strong>four ticket options</strong>: You can choose whether to join the formal dinner for classes 2005 and 2010, and whether you need accommodation. For the first time ever registrations and payments will be handled directly by the Alumni Association via our website AlmaLink. <a href="http://jacobs-alumni.de/homecoming-2015/">Here you can find further details on the ticket options and the event</a>. The exact agenda and ticket prices, however, are currently still being finalized. <strong>So stay tuned for the official invitations to be sent out very soon!</strong>

  Generation Fund – Next Steps
</h2>

<p>
  We are excited to update you on the latest developments for the Generation Fund project. The design stage is ready, the launch is planned at this year’s Homecoming reunion, with the first student starting his/her studies in Fall’16!
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Generation Fund design in a nutshell – how does it work?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Based on the donations received each year, the alumni loan will be awarded to one student (or more upon available funds), according to a predefined scheme. The target for fundraising each year will constitute 9’000 EUR that would be going towards to the recipient selected, on top of the scholarships she/he would already be receiving from Jacobs University. After graduation the student is still given time to follow his/her desired career path and find his/her dream job. Repayment will only start once a minimum yearly gross income of 25’000 EUR per year has been reached. For transparency and fairness, repayment is fixed at an yearly 7% for the duration of 5 years, irrespective of the income, with a total cap of double the loan received.
</p>
<p>
  More information is available on the <strong>Alumni Association Google Shared Space</strong>: an <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/jacobs-alumni.de/file/d/0B4-Rf6jNNbFjZ3l5enZDRzlUVVk/view" target="_blank">infographic</a>, alongside with a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ln0Hpf_c0wfk5Y9bdm6EjURHM-isH05shaHBRTCkyVs/edit" target="_blank">presentation overview</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>When will the fund start?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Since the last Homecoming in September 2014, we have been continuously working together with the  Alumni Consulting Initiative on the design and launch of the Generation Fund. Currently, all the details have already been defined, and we are now in process of putting it in place at the university level.
</p>
<p>
  The reunion in Fall 2014 set the foundation for this new project, while also coinciding with many other changes happening in the university on a structural level. This, together with the consolidation of the past scholarships, has delayed the implementation of the fund, as we originally planned to have a student awarded in Fall ’15. With the university’s new processes aligned,  it is now ready for the launch, with the first student to start his/her studies in Fall 2016. All the donations from Class of ‘04 and ‘09 will be awarded in Fall ’16, along with the funds raised this year at the reunion of Class ’05 and ’10. Target to meet at this year’s Homecoming : 9,000 EUR!
</p>
<p>
  <strong>How to contribute?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Firstly, <strong>anyone can donate into the Generation Fund.</strong> It is very simple! Just follow the link with regards to the bank account details and donate! We have created a separate bank account for the fund, and all donations will go directly towards student loans. The fundraising progress will be transparent and – most importantly – easy to monitor!
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Call for nominations / applications!</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Alongside the donations, we are looking for interested people to create the <strong>Generation Fund Committee. </strong>If you would like to lead the project development alongside the Alumni Board, get involved in the implementation, coordinate the project with all the stakeholders involved, steer the marketing campaign and promote the project within and beyond the Alumni community – then you should <strong>APPLY</strong>! Or <strong>nominate </strong>someone else who you think would be a good fit.
</p>
<p>
  Write us a brief message at <a href="mailto:alumni-board@jacobs-alumni.de">alumni-board@jacobs-alumni.de</a> outlining what can you bring to the team, and why you want to join to by<strong> 23 rd of August </strong>(Sunday,8pm). We will further inform you regarding the selection process.
</p>
<p>
  We are very excited to launch the Generation Fund and set a strong foundation for funding the studies of future Jacobs generations! <strong>Contribute</strong>, <strong>donate</strong> and <strong>get involved</strong>! As part of the alumni network worldwide – we need your support in making this project successful!
</p>

  Our Fees Model – Your Feedback needed!

<p>
  The Alumni Initiative on financial contributions to our association has been very busy over the past months and we would like to<strong> share our results</strong>. A first version of our contributions model is finished and we would need <strong>your feedback</strong> before we present it at the General Assembly in September and implement it in the coming year, 2016. You will see a tiered model appealing to our different alumni groups with the focus on enabling <strong>strong network growth</strong>.

<p>
  Thank you. Thank you for the overwhelming feedback and the support you have shown to our new platform and mailing system. Thank you for bearing up with us during this (sometimes bumpy) transition phase. Thank you for wanting a stronger network. Thank you for being patient, but most importantly thank you for being part of the Alumni Association!
</p>
<p>
  It has been busy. Over the past 6 months, we have been working to provide you with the right tools in order to build a platform which will strengthen our international network of Alumni. We want to make it easy for you to book a room for Homecoming, to make a donation and get a receipt, to locate Alumni anywhere around the world, and to keep in touch with your Alma mater.
</p>
<p>
  Last month we finally started rolling out our new services. You might have noticed that our website got an upgrade. The design is smoother, and it looks fresher than ever. Our mailing server is no longer limited by 200 megabytes of storage, and we can ensure the long term operation of mailing services without being dependant on any third party. Additionally, we now have a full suit of Google products that allows us to work and collaborate together.
</p>
<p>
  Many of you raised privacy concerns. We have updated our privacy policy to reflect the addition of 3rd party service <a href="https://jacobs-alumni.de/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">providers</a>. You can read the full document, which boils down to the following: Your data will remain private. No personal data that we collect will be shared with Google (i.e address etc). No member of the Alumni Association has access to your email or other private data that you choose to backup or upload to Drive.
</p>
<p>
  It has not been an easy process either. The new tech services are being developed by Alumni. Stefan Anca and I have taken into the tasks of upgrading our IT services. Although we are both experts in our fields, we are exploring new areas as we enrich the offers we provide. Together with Alina, we are continuously trying  to provide you a good experience and good support, which is (unfortunately) not always possible.
</p>
<p>
  We realize the importance of having a smooth transition. We have created the following guide that helps you with the most common problems, and answers the most common question in terms of setting up your email with a client, importing your old inbox etc.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>We need your help!</strong> If you have a passion for networks, technology and Jacobs, I invite you to join our effort. By registering you will join a network of IT and Product oriented Alumni and be part of the decisions regarding the architecture and further development of our Services. We are already building a system which will generate your donation receipts automatically (so that you can use them for your tax returns), a mentoring system to enhance the interaction between alumni and students and a global map with alumni and cluster locations so that you can join local events and alumni meetups. If you are interested in joining the IT side of the Alumni Association, please get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:developers@jacobs-alumni.de" target="_blank">developers@jacobs-alumni.de</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We certainly hope you enjoy using the new services and we keep looking forward to your comments, feedback and criticism. We apologize for the bumps encountered during the road, and once more we thank you for being part of the Alumni Association!

  <strong>Alumni Blogging Initiative</strong>
</h2>
<p>
  The Alumni Blog is an initiative of the Alumni Association. The blog thrives through our bloggers, all of which are alumni of Jacobs Unicversity Bremen. We hope to enrich our readers’ daily experience with valuable insights from our personal as well as professional lives, ranging from intercultural encounters to management techniques and more. We hope you can learn from us and we from you. Despite being a very young project, a great amount of readers have been attracted to our blog posts so far. We are always looking for both guest and permanent writers. So if you are interested in writing an article, get in touch with us!
</p>
<p>
  In this newsletter we recall our recent blog posts by Eva, Omaina, Suna and Victoria
</p>
<p>
  Beginning a new chapter in her life, blogger Eva Schmidt ruminates on how a seemingly infinitesimal moment of courage can impact your life. In the space of time it takes for the fluttering of a butterfly’s wings, the human mind can change the course of its destiny. All it takes is <a href="http://jacobs-alumni.de/content/five-seconds-of-courage-2">“Five Seconds of Courage”</a> .
</p>
<p>
  Have you ever felt like a fraud? Have you ever felt that you are leading your life on the edge of a precipice and that every day is a balancing act to maintain the façade that people expect to see? Read about the <a href="http://jacobs-alumni.de/content/a-stranger-in-the-mirror/">“Stranger in the Mirror”</a> by Omaina Aziz that most of us have to face, but few want to admit to.
</p>
<p>
  Screaming <a href="http://jacobs-alumni.de/content/ignoring-is-bliss">“Ignore me!”</a>, Suna Turhan discusses the somewhat counter-intuitive means of dealing with the ever-mounting task list we all face in this day and age of urgency and instant-everything.
</p>
<p>
  Blogger Victoria Rivera puts a new spin on the soulfulness of dance. Drawing on her personal experience and emotions, she describes how dance transcends the physical expression to become a gateway to the soul. <a href="http://jacobs-alumni.de/content/getting-footloose">“Get your footloose!”</a>

<h2>Alumni Profile - Noor Cornelissen (‘13)</h2>

<figure class="uk-padding-small uk-margin-remove" style="float: right;">
  <img src="{{ site.mediaUrl }}who-we-are/Noor-Cornelissen-%E2%80%9813.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
  After graduating from Jacobs with a BA International Politics and History, Noor pursued a Master of Arts in International Development (direction Public Health and Gender) at the Geneva Graduate Institute. She is currently employed by Doctors without Borders, awaiting to be deployed for the first mission in the field.
</p>
<p><strong>Current location:</strong> Geneva/Amsterdam</p>
<p><strong>Nationality</strong> The Netherlands</p>
<p><strong>Job title:</strong> Humanitarian Affairs Officer</p>
<p><strong>Current employer:</strong><a href="http://www.msf.org/">Doctors without Borders (MSF)</a></p>
<p><em>You have some exciting plans upcoming in your professional life. Could you tell us more about it?</em></p>
<p>I just got hired as a Humanitarian Affairs Officer by MSF, for which I will be working in different conflict and emergency situations around the world, relocating every six months. Among other things, I will be responsible for conducting a context analysis of a particular country: politically, socially, economically, and medically. My analysis of the current situation and the potential future developments will then be used by the Head of Mission in that country to create a strategy and coordinate the medical and psycho social teams. I am currently on stand-by, waiting to be sent on my first mission. What attracted me most to the position is the interaction I will get with all different stakeholders, ranging from interviewing patients and community groups on their medical needs and negotiating humanitarian access with government officials to using ‘field data’ to lobby international actors to prevent and respond to emergency situations. In addition to that, I am just very happy to work for an organization whose mission, vision, and approach I share. In my view, MSF is very humble, locally-embedded, and self-critical, qualities often overlooked in the problematic fields of development and humanitarianism.</p>
<p><em>t was your journey since you graduated from Jacobs, in regards to what you are doing now?</em></p>
<p>After Jacobs I moved to Geneva for my MA degree, during which I quickly discovered my interest in public health, particularly sexual and reproductive health and rights. After an internship with UNAIDS in Geneva and a research project in a women’s hospital in Nairobi, I was certain that I wanted to continue specializing in health issues while being in ‘the field’. In that sense, MSF is truly the perfect place for me.</p>
<p><em>Any interesting upcoming plans??</em></p>
<p>I am waiting to be deployed on a mission and it can be anywhere in the world – so I am pretty excited for this uncertain adventure!</p>
<p><em>Any favorite course from Jacobs that you found particularly useful after graduation?</em></p>
<p>History of Development by Corinna Unger – This course and this particular professor influenced my career path significantly. I could recommend any course by her actually. Prof. Unger is encouraging and dedicated and has a very critical, informed view on the field of development. One of my essays from that class served as the basis of a writing sample for one of my later job applications and I remember looking back at those class notes for one of my master courses.</p>
<p><em>Looking back, what do you miss most about Jacobs?</em></p>
<p>I’d have to say those B2 chill sessions in Michael Lawrence and Harri Geiger’s room spent doing Hello Kitty puzzles, watching Pokemon, playing with our dwarf bunnies we ordered on Ebay, and finding other great ways to procrastinate.</p>
<p><em>What advice would you give to current Jacobs students?</em></p>
<p>Try to change what you do not like about Jacobs or initiate what you think is missing! You should be the ones designing your own education and the institution needs your critical feedback and great energy while you are still there.</p>
<p><em>One favorite Jacobs memory/ or one thing you are grateful for.</em></p>
<p>I am grateful for the people I met at Jacobs and the connections we established. Coming from a somewhat Utopian international high school (UWC), I was a bit scared that it could only go downhill from there. Fortunately, Jacobs offered a really wonderful, warm, and diverse community that made me feel at home very soon. My favorite memories include shisha nights at the Cottage and the silent disco outside at the pond.</p>
<p><em>Interesting “Jacobs” fact about Noor</em></p>
<p>I just spent a wonderful night in Kenya partying at the beach with five generations of Jacobs alumni. We were the only ones on the dance floor, having lots of fun, and looking quite ridiculous. When I closed my eyes, I felt like I could see the lime-green walls and the trash bag covered windows of H3.</p>
