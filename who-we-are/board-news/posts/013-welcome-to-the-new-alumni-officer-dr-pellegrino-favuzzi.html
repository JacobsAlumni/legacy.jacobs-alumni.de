    Dear Jacobs University Alumni,
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a great pleasure to inform you all that a new Alumni and Career Services Officer has joined our team at Jacobs University, Dr. Pellegrino Favuzzi.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pellegrino received a Ph.D. in Philosophy and Intellectual History at the Humboldt University of Berlin and at the University of Padua in 2013, holding afterwards postdoctoral positions in Berlin and Hamburg.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beside of his scientific work, Pellegrino has been engaging for a long time in the field of Alumni Management in Italy. In 2010 he was founding member of the Alumni Association of the Galileo Galilei School of Higher Education, the excellence initiative of the University of Padua, holding the office of president for the last six years. Moreover, as member of the board of governors from 2015, he had the opportunity to actively contribute to the founding process of the newly established Alumni Association of the University of Padua.
  </p>
  <p>
    As Alumni Officer, Pellegrino will be an interface between Jacobs University and its Alumni community as a growing and dynamic network of international students, researchers and professionals. He will particularly coordinate Jacobs University’s programs and services for and with Alumni, cooperating closely with the Jacobs University Bremen Alumni Association for the development of its growing scope of activities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wherever you are and whatever you do, we are glad to offer you all a further opportunity to stay in touch and to participate in Jacobs University community life.
  </p>
  <p>
    We look forward to welcoming you at next Alumni Homecoming!
  </p>
