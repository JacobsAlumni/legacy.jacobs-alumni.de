<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>
    The Homecoming Organization Committee is excited to welcome you for this year's Homecoming from 21<sup>st</sup> -23<sup>rd</sup> of September on campus. 
    The Committee is working day and night to make this one of the most unforgettable weekends in recent Jacobs memory.
</p>
<p>
    Many aspects will remain as in earlier years, most notably the combination of Homecoming with the Career Symposium on Friday and the Jacobs Games (formerly Olympix). 
    We are excited to host this year’s Gala Dinner at Jacobs University in the Campus Center’s East Wing. 
    Like last year, the dinner will be open to all Alumni, regardless of their graduating class. 
    As it was last year, the Alumni Association General Assembly to Saturday Afternoon – allowing all of us to enjoy a calm Saturday morning on campus and to be well rested for the Homecoming “Blast to the Past” party on Saturday night.
</p>

<p>
    Please note that the general assembly will be live-streamed. More information can be found on <a href='/livestream/'>the livestream page</a>.

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<h3>I am not part of Class of 2008 or 2013. Can I still join the event?</h3>
<p>
    Absolutely! 
    Homecoming is an event for all Jacobs alumni – and their partners and children. 
    That includes recent graduates and also exchange students. 
    As in the previous year the Gala Dinner at East Wing will be open to all alumni. 
    Everybody can purchase tickets for Homecoming, however being a member of the alumni association will allow you to buy them at a discounted price. 
</p>

<h3>What will happen at the Gala Dinner?</h3>

<p>
    This year’s Gala Dinner will happen in the East Wing of the Campus Center, which will open its doors at 6pm on Saturday for a champagne reception. 
    At 6:30pm the agenda will begin with a welcome address, after which the grand buffet will be opened, we will enjoy a three-course dinner. 
    All drinks are included in the ticket price. 
    And yes, you can bring your partner along. 
    This year we will also have some musical performances by Pablo Ochoa! 
    The new scholarship recipient will be introduced, and we will feature the first-ever student art auction to raise money for the Alumni Scholarship Fund. 
    Please note that participation is only included in the full ticket.
</p>

<h3>Will there be any sports activities?</h3>

<p>
    We are lucky to have Olympix – now “Jacobs Games” – taking place on the same weekend as Homecoming. 
    Alumni are invited to join the “graduate teams” and be once again part of this crazy competition. 
    Sports alumni can join are the following: Basketball, Football, Dodgeball, Volleyball, Tug of War, E-sports. 
    You may already voice your interested in joining any sport by writing to alumni@jacobs-university, but we will also send out a survey for this purpose closer to the events once also the grad captains are settled. 
    The main venue of the Jacobs Games will be the Sports and Convention Center, where there are also showers available. 
    A detailed schedule of the event can be found at the bottom of this page when it becomes available. 
    One event that we would like to point out here, though, is the Cheerleading Finale right after the Gala Dinner on Saturday. 
    An alumni group will be performing (out of competition), too!
</p>

<h3>Where can I RSVP for Homecoming and check who else is coming?</h3>

<h3>How can I make donations?</h3>

    Additional fees might apply when paying through credit card.
</p>

<h3>Can I cancel my ticket purchases?</h3>

<p>
    All tickets are fully refundable until a week before the end of the sales period on September 14. 
    No refunds will be given upon cancellation of late registrations.
</p>

<h3>Can I get accommodation on campus?</h3>

<p>
    Unfortunately, this year there is no on-campus accommodation available. 
    Even the Guest House is fully booked. 
    The rooms in College Nordmetall will be filled up with freshmen – a large class is expected this year. 
    If you decide to be a guest at any student’s dorm, be sure that the student informs the security team in advance!
</p>

<h3>What about accommodation off-campus?</h3>

<p>
    You can of course book accommodation in any hotel there is in Bremen, preferably well advance, as rooms are booked out quickly. 
    We encourage you to also get in touch with your former host family in Bremen. 
    Maybe you can arrange a night or two with them.
</p>

<h3>I am staying not too close to campus. Can I store luggage and change on campus?</h3>

<p>
    Since this year there will not be any on-campus accommodation available due to the large incoming student batch, we are making every effort to mitigate any inconveniences caused especially for those staying further away from campus. 
    In particular, on Saturday there are two dress codes, casual for the day and formal for the evening, and going back to your hotel to change might not be feasible. 
    We put a slot in which you can change, from after the General Assembly at 16:30 to the beginning of the Gala Danner at 18:30. 
    However, if this is to short you can bring the outfit for the evening to campus (or any other belongings) and store it in the Alumni Lounge (see map in agenda), which is open between 10:00 and 20:00. 
    This is a general alumni meeting spot that will be looked after by a student assistant. 
    You can change in the bathrooms there or go over to the Sports & Convention Center and use its changing rooms. 
    Any stuff that you want to leave for the night, you can leave at the Alumni Lounge, which will be closed for the night and re-opened the following morning. 
    You may also bring any belongings to the party, which has a cloakroom set up. 
    Please note that any of those storing services are at your own risk and that we cannot be held liable for any damage or loss that might occur to your belongings.
</p>

<h3>Where can I get my Welcome Package and what is in it?</h3>

<p>
    The Welcome Packages will be ready in the foyer of the foyer of the university Campus Center. 
    If you are arriving late, you can also pick them up Saturday during the Chill&Grill-BBQ. 
    The package will include your wristband for the BBQ, Gala Dinner and party, meal vouchers, prints of all schedules.
