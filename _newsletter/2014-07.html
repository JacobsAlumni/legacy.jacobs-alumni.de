  Congratulations and a very warm-hearted welcome to a total of 386 new alumni! On Friday, June 6, 262 Bachelor, 70 Master and 54 PhD students received their diplomas at their graduation. An audience of more than 1,200 guests cheered for the Class of 2014 as President Katja Windt, and keynote speaker Angela Titzrath, Board Member for Human Resources of Deutsch Post DHL, congratulated the graduates on their achievements.
</p>
<p>
  With current developments and challenges at Jacobs, the common theme of the event was naturally change and what it means to one’s personal development. President Windt quoted on Bertolt Brecht, saying that “only those who change remain true to themselves”, while emphasizing the importance of retaining the universities core values and principles in the process – internationality and transdisciplinarity in research and teaching at a place of inspiration.
</p>
<p>
  Keynote speaker Angela Titzrath encouraged the graduates to take on responsibility and to grow into leadership positions. “I am deeply convinced that what the world needs in such a challenging environment is more bright and passionate people ready to take on responsibility – in society, in business as well as in politics,” she said.
</p>
<p>
  In an analogy, Alumni President Peter Dabrowski highlighted that change is as much a theme of today, as was pioneering for the first graduating Class of 2004. These are experiences that will shape your character and personal development for the rest of your life.
</p>
<p>
  Highlights on stage were not only student live performances among others by Lebogang Shilakoe, as the Alumni scholarship recipient of Class 2006, Ernesto Gonzales and Rosario Freire, but also the undergraduate and graduate speeches by Eva Schmitz and Tilak KC. We invite you to watch their commencement speeches below:
</p>
<p>
  In typical Jacobs graduation tradition, the Bremen weather presented itself from its best side with clear blue skies and 28 degrees while the ceremony finished off with a well-attended reception in front of the IRC and a graduation ball that went on until the early morning hours.

  Message from President Windt
</h2>
<p>
  Dear Alumni of Jacobs University,
</p>
<p>
  First, I’d like to thank you all for the support you, as alumni, have shown your alma mater and me in recent months and for being an active part in Jacobs University’s Change Process through the Change Teams, the Curriculum Sounding Board and the Alumni Consulting Initiative.
</p>
<p>
  Back in April, I presented an overview of the ongoing realignment of Jacobs University to some of you at the gathering of the Jacobs University Foundation of America and Alumni Association in New York.
</p>
<p>
  I am happy to now inform all of you in this newsletter about the latest developments and recent changes in the new organizational structure of Jacobs University.
</p>
<p>
  In June, we presented our plans of the realignment of Jacobs University at meetings of a special committee set up by the City State of Bremen (Begleitausschuss) and the Board of Governors of Jacobs University. I am pleased about the great approval and support we received for our plans at both meetings.
</p>
<p>
  The business plan for Jacobs University includes significant changes: With DIVERSITY, HEALTH, MOBILITY, we have already introduced three new focus areas for research and education.
</p>
<p>
  “Diversity of modern societies” describes the research area that regards the individual in his or her entity as a biological, psychological and socially determined being and thus contributes to decipher modern global society. In “Health with focus on bioactive substances” Jacobs University develops solutions for a healthier world. Researchers are investigating the safe application of bioactive substances in food, plants and marine algae and medication. “Mobility of people, goods and information” deals with understanding the global movement of people goods and information. All three foci have one thing in common: they unite our expertise in different disciplines to develop new solutions and approaches.
</p>
<p>
  We are currently working on reshaping our portfolio of undergraduate and graduate study programs offered to students starting in 2015.&nbsp; Our new program portfolio will consist of study programs with an economically viable perspective. All new study programs will be designed with a clear focus on efficiency, sustainability and attractiveness, by which we mean academic excellence as well as relevance for market demands.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, a new organizational structure of Jacobs University is also an important part of the realignment of Jacobs University. The Executive Board is formed by myself and the Managing Director, while the next senior level includes three Academic Deans and Heads of Administrative Departments.
</p>
<p>
  After a positive decision by the Board of Governors at their June meeting, the appointments for the position of Managing Director and the positions of two of the Deans have now been made.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Prof. Dr. Michael Hülsmann</strong> has joined me in the Executive Board of Jacobs University as Managing Director of Jacobs University. He is responsible for all non-academic departments. We will jointly develop Jacobs University’s strategy and be responsible for reaching the set economic targets.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Prof. Dr. Arvid Kappas</strong> has been appointed as Dean. He is responsible for the entire area of Graduate and Executive Education as well as the focus area DIVERSITY (in modern societies).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Prof. Dr. Werner Nau</strong> has also taken on the role of Dean with responsibility for the entire area of Undergraduate Education and the focus area HEALTH (focus on bioactive substances).
</p>
<p>
  The third position of Dean, responsible for Research and Transfer and the focus area MOBILITY (of people, goods and information), will be filled externally. Until then, Arvid Kappas and Werner Nau will also be responsible for these areas on an interim basis.
</p>
<p>
  Together with this leadership team I look forward to steering Jacobs University into a successful future.
</p>
<p>
  I also look forward to working and exchanging ideas with the Jacobs University’s Alumni Association and very much appreciate your continuous involvement and support of the Change Process.
</p>
<p>
  In September, I will meet you at the Homecoming and the double reunion to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Alumni Association with you.
</p>
<p>
  Take care and best wishes
</p>
<p>
  Katja Windt

  AlmaLink Update
</h2>
<figure>
  <img src="/media/newsletters/2014-07/news4.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
  AlmaLink Phase I is completed! And you’re looking at it right now : Previewed at the Jacobs University Foundation of America reunion at the end of April, the new version of AlmaLink officially went live under www.jacobs-alumni.de on Graduation day in June. The system, currently still under development, was presented to the freshest of graduates in Peter’s Alumni address at the end of the Graduation ceremony on campus.
</p>
<p>
  As mentioned before, the current state of the system represents the outcome of the first out of 3 phases of development of AlmaLink 2.0. It comprises of the relaunch of the website and the content pages, with user registration and login. Some webpages are available to the public, and others are available only to logged in members. Thus, we are able to present ourselves to the outside world and share confidential information inside the Association.
</p>
<p>
  Although the user profiles can’t offer much more functionality at current time other than logging in and commenting on articles, we invited all the Graduates of the class of 2014 to register as new users. This way, the Alumni of Class 2014 are part of our platform from the very beginning and they even have to option to get involved in the further development of the system at a very early stage, just like the beta-users.
</p>
<p>
  What is coming up in Phase II will be the full profile functionality: interactions between users through messages, groups, forums, blogs, so you can, for example, find out what the Alumni Chapter Berlin is planning this month and be able to post an opening for an internship in your company. Also, search capabilities based on profile information will be available, so you can easily find Alumni in the next city you travel to. Phase II should be ready by Homecoming, in September.
</p>
<p>
  Phase III is planned to be completed by the beginning of next year and it will integrate external stakeholders to the Alumni Association, like the Jacobs Career Service Center, and event management so that we can organize the next Homecoming directly through AlmaLink.
</p>
<p>
  The development of the system is an organic process and is not set in stone. The fact that you are seeing this Newsletter directly in AlmaLink, and not in PDF form as before, is an experiment and a test to see if the current system can fulfill our needs for the future. Please bare with us if the layouting is not perfect or some parts are missing, we’re still working on it . That being said, your feedback is very valuable so please let us know what you think could be improved with the current newsletter. We require and appreciate your help as Alumni to guide us through the process of shaping AlmaLink into the system that we all want to keep us connected. You can provide your valuable feedback by getting in contact with me at <a style="color: #00b1ec;" href="mailto:sanca@jacobs-alumni.de">sanca@jacobs-alumni.de</a>.

  Update on the Alumni Consulting Initiative
</h2>
<p>
  The teams that comprise the Alumni Consulting Initiative are now complete and have been hard at work in recent weeks. The ACI presently seeks to support Jacobs along two workstreams: Student Marketing Support and Tuition Financing. Interim results are currently in discussion with the university leadership, and the teams will complete their current engagements by the end of summer.
</p>
<p>
  Student Marketing Support focuses on how to shape recruiting strategy based on analysis of global education markets and of aggregate past admissions data. The workstream further seeks to find ways for alumni to get more involved with student marketing – calls to action to follow soon.
</p>
<p>
  Tuition Financing is mapping out options to reduce the debt pool currently owed to Jacobs directly, looks to find ways for “healthier” student loans to be available in the future and has investigated a range of options for tuition funding that go beyond mere cash loans. There is something in the works for Homecoming in September – stay tuned!
</p>
<p>
  In case of further questions or ideas, feel free to contact the ACI coordinators Axel Domeyer ’06, Jan-Dirk Früchtenicht ’05, or Henrik Maedler ’07.

  From Idea to Business: Entrepreneurs’ Day at Jacobs University
</h2>
<figure>
  <img src="/media/newsletters/2014-07/news7.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption>
    A university is a melting pot of ideas. Some of them might be so enticing that those first thoughts soon take on shape: a student project turned into a business. At the first Entrepreneurs’ Day at Jacobs University students and alumni have had the chance to present a number of different projects. The Entrepreneur’s Day offered the opportunity for future business founders to enter into a dialogue with potential partners and experts. The start-up founders could have their business model evaluated and got tips how to possibly optimize their solutions and market them effectively.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Nine start-up founders used the chance and presented their projects at Jacobs University’s first Entrepreneurs’ Day in front of representatives from business and finance. Their ideas ranged from information technology, finance and industry services to energy provision and biotechnology.
</p>
<p>
  The event underlines Jacobs University’s aim to strengthen the entrepreneurial spirit among its students and alumni and to intensify contacts to the industry at the same time.
</p>
<p>
  Prof. Dr.-Ing. Katja Windt, President of Jacobs University, said: “Our experience has shown that during such events, and at Jacobs University in general, ideas are generated and further developed. We know of several successful start-ups which students and alumni are part of. “
</p>
<p>
  To identify more opportunities for cooperation and to support start-ups even more in future, was one of the goals, she said. “Our university is a meeting point. But encounters should not only take place based on background, interest or professions on our campus alone, we’d like to increasingly build on our contacts to partners outside of Jacobs University. It is those kinds of networks that our students can benefit from way beyond their education,” Prof. Dr.-Ing. Windt continued.
</p>
<p>
  Potential start-up founders at the event were happy about the opportunity to gain some valuable feedback: “There are so many talented students at Jacobs University with very innovative start-up ideas. But to turn them into reality someday, investment is necessary. This event is such a great chance to get in touch with entrepreneurs and potential supporters and to get a step closer to realize your idea,“ reckons Philipp Herzberg, one of the alumni presenting their project.
</p>
<p>
  The Entrepreneurs’ Day, which is to become a regular event on campus, is only one of the measures to strengthen the entrepreneurial spirit on campus. “Together with students, faculty, alumni and industry representatives we’d like to initiate, accompany, and foster of growth-oriented start-ups. We are thinking about a broad range of offers such as a start-up consultancy, attractive and integrated education that inspires and enables a future generation of entrepreneurs as well as further education and a strong network of entrepreneurs, “explained President Windt. In a first step the university will be offering office space on campus to start-ups.

  <a id="Tale_of_two_universities_MIT_and_Jacobs" name="Tale_of_two_universities_MIT_and_Jacobs"></a>
  A Tale of Two Universities: Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Jacobs University Bremen
</h2>
<p>
  Today, MIT is a world famous private university with the 6th largest endowment ($11 billion) in the United States. It wasn’t always so.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
  In 1859 William Barton Rogers submitted a proposal to the legislature of the State of Massachusetts for a new private institution of higher learning that would be housed on publicly owned lands in Boston. Two years later, on April 10, 1861 the governor of Massachusetts signed a charter that granted land for a new private institution of higher education, the “Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston Society of Natural History”. Two days later the American Civil War began.
</p>
<p>
  Because of the war, Rogers, who had been appointed President, had great difficulty raising funds for the new institution. Nevertheless, after the war ended, in May, 1865, MIT’s first classes were held in rented space in Boston, and in 1866 its first building was built.
</p>
<p>
  The war was not the only reason it was difficult to raise funds. Most people failed to see a need for, or to understand, the new style of education that MIT represented.
</p>
<p>
  MIT survived for eight years, in a constant state of financial crisis. Then, the Panic of 1873, a severe economic collapse, hit North America and Europe. The subsequent Long Depression lasted 6 years. Enrollments at MIT decreased sharply after 1875 and the financial situation, never easy, became grim. By 1878 – its thirteenth year – MIT had abolished three professorships; reduced faculty salaries; and the Board of Trustees considered closing the institution. Under these circumstances, the second president retired. The trustees were unable to find a successor. They asked Rogers, who was then 75 years of age, to return as interim President.
</p>
<p>
  President Rogers succeeded in finding a young but distinguished successor who assumed the Presidency in 1881 – the 16th year of operation. One reason it was difficult for MIT to build a stable financial foundation in this period was the existence of the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard – the oldest university in the United States – and potential benefactors were at best indifferent and often hostile to the young institution.
</p>
<p>
  The new President and the Trustees lobbied the Massachusetts Legislature for a $200,000 grant (More than $4 million today). Although MIT was private, they successfully argued that these public monies would aid the industrial development of Massachusetts. The Legislature approved a grant of $300,000 to be paid over two years. In the following years, the State continued to provide grants amounting to more than $1.6 million (Probably more than $40 million today) until the practice was ended in 1921.
</p>
<p>
  Between 1881 and 1897, enrollment quadrupled from 302 to 1,198 students, faculty appointments grew from 38 to 156, and the endowment grew from $137,000 (About $2.8 million today) to $1,798,000 (About $43 million).
</p>

<hr />

<p>
  One hundred and forty years after the proposal for founding MIT was submitted to the State of Massachusetts, a plan was proposed to the City-State of Bremen to create a private university of higher learning with a style of education new to Germany. The City-State approved the plan and contributed seed monies, and the new university obtained the land and buildings of a decommissioned military base for use as a campus.
</p>
<p>
  Two years later, in September 2001, Jacobs University – then called International University Bremen – opened, just days after the 9/11 attack in America. The effects of 9/11 created great uncertainty that lasted for many years in Europe as well as in the United States.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/media/newsletters/2014-07/news8.jpg" alt=""/>
  <figcaption>
    The uncertainty made it difficult to get the attention of potential benefactors. It was a difficult time to be raising money, no matter how promising the hopes for the new university might be. In America, which has a tradition of educational and international philanthropy, all eyes were turned inward and wallets were closed. In Bremen, which had no tradition of private philanthropy for education, many potential benefactors and the general public were hostile to the new institution which they saw as elitist and in potential competition with the older, established, University of Bremen. Although the people of Bremen relied on and rewarded elitism in their football team, they objected to it in education. Others failed to see the need for the new style of education that Jacobs represented, or saw its internationalism as a threat.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  The new university became the first private university in Germany to be accredited and, in 2004, graduated its first class. During this initial period of academic success, efforts to raise endowment funds were less successful. The University developed for five years in a constant state of financial crisis. Then, in 2006, it received what was at the time the largest donation for education in European history when the Jacobs family committed €200 million. To honor their confidence in its future, the University changed its name to Jacobs University Bremen.
</p>
<p>
  Almost immediately, in 2007, a severe global economic collapse hit North America and Europe. The subsequent Long, or Great, Recession had already lasted 6 years. The financial situation of the University, never easy, was grim.
</p>
<p>
  The President and the Trustees successfully lobbied the City-State for supplemental monies based on the tax revenues brought in by its activities. Although Jacobs was private, it successfully argued that the requested public monies would aid the industrial development of the City-State. The City-State approved a grant against a background of political controversy and continued to provide grants with the understanding that the practice would soon be ended.
</p>
<p>
  By 2014 – its thirteenth year – Jacobs had secured its budget through 2017 but was still struggling to raise sufficient funds to cover the impending budget shortfall after that time. Under these circumstances, the third president, who had served less than one year, left the university.
</p>

<hr />

<figure>
  <img src="/media/newsletters/2014-07/news9.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
  In the meantime, the growing number of alumni of Jacobs University have gone on to prestigious graduate schools and to significant positions in corporations; the faculty have succeeded in winning an ever-growing number of research contracts and grants; and students from more than 100 countries rate Jacobs University highly and testify to the effectiveness of its educational programs.
</p>
<p>
  In similar circumstances, the MIT Trustees were unable to find a successor and asked President Rogers, who was then 75 years of age, to return as interim President. It remains to be seen how the Jacobs Trustees will proceed. Although the MIT Trustees considered closing the institution, that turned out to have been the wrong path to consider.
</p>
<p>
  Building a great university is not the work of one year, or of one decade. Building a great university is not for the faint of heart. Success neither comes, nor can it be judged, in the heat of the moment.
